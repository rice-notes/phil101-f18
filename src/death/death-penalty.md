# Death Penalty

* 61% of voters wouldn't choose capital punishment for murder
* 50% of executions occur in Texas which has 12% of the population

## Van den Haag: On Deterrence and the Death Penalty

### Distribution of Executions

An argument against capital punishment is that capital punishment is unfairly
applied to different racial groups:

* african americans 3x more likely to be put on death row
* if a white person was killed, guilty also 3x more likely to put on death row

Van den Haag argues that this isn't a question of the death penalty, but rather
it's implementation.  He poses this thought: if the death penalty is moral,
then no distribution of executions would make it immoral.  If the death penalty
is immoral, then no distribution of executions could make it moral.  So we
can't make an argument based off of the distribution.

### Miscarriages of Justice

We end up executing several innocent people.  An argument against cap. punishment
is that it's immoral because we end up executing innocent people.

Van den Haag dismisses this by claiming that we exercise many risky behaviors
in which casualities are common because of the value they provide us.  Not
exercising a behavior because of the risks is a slipperly slope and we
shouldn't set a precedent of that.  He claims we get value from executing the
guilty - do we?

### Deterrence

* 80% of executions occur in the South (Highest Murder Rates)
* less than 1% of executions occur in the Northeast (Lowest Murder Rates)

Does capital punishment even deter further crimes? There is no statistical
evidence of deterrence.  Van den Haag dismisses this by explaining that it
doesn't matter - if we can save a few victims lives by deterrence then it's
worth it.

### Costs

* in Texas, death row cost 2.3 million, roughly 3x the cost of 40 years in
  prison
* if capital punishment 

### Brutalization



### Degradation (Kantian argument)

Execution is the ultimate degradation of human life, and is therefore
inconsistent with human dignity.

However, Haag brings up Kant's original argument in favor of the death penalty:

    execution is a way of affirming an individual's humanity by affirming their
    rationality...
