# Euthanasia

Working definition:  

    Taking the life of a human who is believed to be suffering from a disease
    or injury from recover cannot reasonably be expected.

For now, we'll not include accidental deaths, e.g. treatment kills them. 


## Gay Williams

We'll also be ignoring cases of Passive Euthanasia, in which we do not provide
a treatment that is continuing to keep someone alive, e.g. pulling someone off
life-support.

### nature argument

Human beings have a natural inclination to live, so taking one's or a loved
one's life is damaging to our natural inclinations.

### self-interest argument

Euthansia goes against our own self-interest of living a good life.  Patients
could be mis-diagnosed or new developments in medicine could save them in the
future.  So, euthanasia is a case where the patient is giving up too easily.

### practical-effects argument

Allowing euthanasia could create lazy nurses and doctors, that wouldn't attempt
to save the life of a complicated patient.  Might allowing euthanasia be a
slippery slope which allows people to give up easier than they should?
