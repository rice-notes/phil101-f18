# Consequentialism

The driving theory behind consequentialism considers the "goodness" of the 
consequences of actions:

    An action is right if and only if (and because) its consequences would be 
    at least as good as the consequences of any alternative action.

This definition poses multiple questions:  
* what defines good?
* what consequences should we be considering?

## Utilitarianism

Originally developed by Jeremy Bentham, refined by John Stuart Mill.

Goodness is definied has "human welfare", or utility.  This reduces the previous
definition from consequences to utility.

How to define utility?

### Hedonism

A form of utilitarianism in which utility measures pleasure and pain.

#### Experience Machine

Robert Nozick created a thought experiment to counter hedonism.  Consider below:

    Nozick asks us to imagine a machine that could give us whatever desirable
    or pleasurable experiences we could want. Psychologists have figured out a
    way to stimulate a person's brain to induce pleasurable experiences that
    the subject could not distinguish from those he would have apart from the
    machine. He then asks, if given the choice, would we prefer the machine to
    real life?

    Nozick also believes that if pleasure were the only intrinsic value, people
    would have an overriding reason to be hooked up to an "experience machine,"
    which would produce favorable sensations.

### Perfectionism

Utility is measures the number of "perfectionist good".  

## Rule Consequentialism

Rather than considering each action's utility individually, create an ordered
set of rules which dictate which actions are permitted.  Rules will be added
by considering all possible scenarios applicable to a given rule.
