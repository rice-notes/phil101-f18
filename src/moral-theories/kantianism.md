# Kantianism

Rather than truely optimizing for utility or pleasure, Kant believes than in
addition to wanting to feel pleasure, humans long for something more than just
hedonistic pleasure: humans want to have free will and decide their own future.

Rights based moral theories tend to be very Kantian in their nature.

## Formulations

Kant posits that the following formulations are equivalent definitions for 
Kantianism, these is known as the *categorical imperative*.

### Humanity Formulation

    An action is right if and only if the actions treat the persons as **ends 
    in themselves** and **not merely as a means**.

### Universal Law Formulation

    An action is right if and only if one can both
    * **consistently conceive** of everyone adopting and acting on the maxim
    * **consistently will** that everyone will act on it
