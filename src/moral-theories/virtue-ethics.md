# Virtue Ethics

Most moral theories focus on analyzing specific scenarios, and creating a 
decision framework for planning an action.  In contrast, virtue ethics attempts
to define the *ideal* type of person by defining virtues one should hold, and 
vices one should not.

### Aristotle's Golden Mean

Aristotle defines a virtue as a "mean" between two excesses of a trait.  For
example, there exists a middle ground between cowardice and foolhardiness that
is courage.  Cowardice is a deficiency of coura

Other pairs:
* courage / cowardice
* honesty / dishonesty
* justince / injustice
  * I view this one as circular rather than linear from deficient to excess.  
    Injustice is represented between two parties, Justice is an equal balance
    between the two.
* temperance / intemperance
* benficience / selfishness
* loyalty / disloyalty
* humility / arrogance
* gratitude / ingratitude 

## Applying Virtue Ethics

We define 3 categories: morally required, optional, and wrong.  To classify a
situation into one of those categories, we consider what a virtuous agent would
do in one of those situations.  

One concern is that we define a virtuous agent as one who commits virtuous
acts, and we're defining a virtuous act is one that a virtuous agent would
commit.  When making a virtue ethics argument, it's important to make sure we
have a working definition of virtuous acts to base off of.
