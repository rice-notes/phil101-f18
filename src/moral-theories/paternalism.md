# Paternalism

A moral approach where restrictions of freedom can and should be imposed upon
a group if it is decided that such freedoms can harm individuals or society.

    "We know what's best for you, don't do that"

    "the exercise of power over an individual and an interference with an
    individual's free will"

## Distinctions

Paternalism is described in two different forms.

### Pure Paternalism

Restricting a person or group of persons freedom in order to protect them 
from an evil or a danger they might otherwise partake.

### Impure Paternalism

Restricting a person or group of persons freedom in order to protect another
distinct group from an evil or danger they might otherwise partake.

## Utilitarian Argument against Paternalism

John Stuart Mill argues that any restriction of one's free will does not
justify any potential benefit.  

    "Paternalism always wrong because it goes against what it means to be a 
    rational autonomous agent."

    "A man's mode of laying out his existence ... but because it his is own"


## Support of Paternalism

Dworkin argues that it's plausible a rational agent might agree to some
paternalistic restrictions imposed on them.  Specifically in some of these 
decisions:  
* concerns goods that are needed to pursue other goods
* made under psych/sociological pressures
* involves dangers not sufficiently understood or appreciated by participants

### Dworkin's Conclusion

Paternalism isn't always bad.  It can be good in some scenarios, but should
be used sparingly.

## Goodin, Permissible Paternalism

**Paternalism might be justified where public officials ...**

When is paternalism morally permissable? Never? Sometimes? According to Goodin,
it is permissable when the following conditions are satisfied.

### Relevant Preferences

Sometimes, a person's current decision is a **factually incorrect** approach to
satisfy their (deeper, possibly not explicit) preferences.  In that case,
Goodin argues that it's OK to apply a paternalistic argument if you're 
overriding their *surface preferences* for their true *deeper preferences*.

#### Example: Smoking

* Surface Preference: Smoking cigarettes
* Deeper Preference: Staying alive and bodily intact
